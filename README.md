## Challenge Overview

This project was developed as part of a front-end coding challenge with the following requirements:
- Redesign the skip selection page from wewantwaste.co.uk to look completely different while maintaining functionality
- Focus on clean, maintainable React code, responsiveness, and UI/UX improvements
- Ensure proper display on both mobile and desktop browsers
- Use live API data from wewantwaste.co.uk to populate skip options

## Features

- âœ… **Dark/Light Theme Support** - Attractive color schemes for both modes with automatic system preference detection
- âœ… **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop
- âœ… **Modern UI Elements** - Interactive components with subtle animations and transitions
- âœ… **Progress Tracking** - Visual progress indicator showing the booking journey
- âœ… **Interactive Cards** - Visual skip selection with detailed information
- âœ… **Accessibility** - WCAG compliant with proper focus indicators and reduced motion support

## Technology Stack

- React 19
- CSS3 with CSS Variables for theming
- Context API for state management
- Custom Hooks for data fetching
- Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Design Approach

### Theming System

The application uses a robust theming system based on CSS variables that enables seamless switching between dark and light modes. The theme is controlled via a Context API provider that:

- Detects user system preferences
- Stores user preference in local storage
- Provides an intuitive toggle UI component
- Applies theme changes in real-time

### Visual Design

The design follows these key principles:

1. **Clarity** - Clear visual hierarchy, readable typography, and intuitive interactions
2. **Consistency** - Uniform spacing, consistent color usage, and cohesive component design
3. **Feedback** - Interactive elements provide visual feedback through subtle animations
4. **Aesthetics** - Modern, clean visual style with appropriate use of shadows, gradients, and transitions

### Component Architecture

Components are built with reusability and maintainability in mind:

- **SkipSelector** - Main orchestrating component that manages state and layout
- **ProgressBar** - Visual indicator of the user's journey through the selection process
- **SkipCard** - Interactive card displaying skip information and selection controls
- **ThemeToggle** - Animated toggle for switching between themes
- **LoadingSpinner** - Feedback component for asynchronous operations

### UX Enhancements

- **Entrance Animations** - Components animate into view to create a polished experience
- **Interactive Elements** - Buttons, cards, and toggles have hover/focus states with subtle transitions
- **Loading States** - Clear indicators when data is loading
- **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages with recovery options
- **Responsive Behavior** - Layout adapts to different screen sizes with appropriate component sizing
